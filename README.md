# Signal-Acquisition-algorithm
In the Data Acquisition and Processing course, I developed a project that takes an audio signal and analyzes it in the time and frequency domain. The project is developed within the LabWindows CVI program.
Within the project, I applied different filters, both for the time domain (mediating filter) and for the frequency domain (low pass Butterworth filter).
